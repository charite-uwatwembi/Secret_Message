# Secret Message Transformation

The Secret Message Transformation project involves transforming an array of strings into a secret message using various array methods.

## Description

The project consists of several steps to manipulate the `secretMessage` array using array methods such as `pop`, `push`, `splice`, `shift`, and `unshift`. These methods are used to remove and add elements, replace specific words, and print the secret message as a sentence.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:
1. Perform the array transformations as outlined in the project instructions.
2. Check the length of the array to verify the changes made at each step.
3. Print the final secret message as a sentence using `console.log()` and `join()`.
